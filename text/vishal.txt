Q. What are local variables and global variables in Python?

Global Variables: Variables declared outside a function or in a global space are called global variables. These variables can be accessed by any function in the program.

Local Variables: Any variable declared inside a function is known as a local variable. This variable is present in the local space and not in the global space.
